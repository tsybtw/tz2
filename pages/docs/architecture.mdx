# System Architecture

The Conference Registration System is designed with a modular, layered architecture, primarily following the structure promoted by the FastAPI framework.

## Components

1.  **Client (Browser):**
    *   Interacts with the user, rendering HTML pages served by the application.
    *   Sends HTTP requests for registration, login, profile updates, and viewing participant lists.
    *   Executes client-side JavaScript for UI enhancements and basic form validation.

2.  **Web Server (Uvicorn):**
    *   An ASGI server that runs the FastAPI application.
    *   Handles incoming HTTP requests and forwards them to the FastAPI application.

3.  **FastAPI Application (`app.main.py`):**
    *   The core of the backend application.
    *   Initializes the FastAPI app instance, mounts routers, middleware, and static files.

    *   **Web Routes (`app.web.py`):**
        *   Handles requests that return HTML pages.
        *   Uses Jinja2 templates to render dynamic content.
        *   Manages user sessions and access control for web pages.

    *   **API Routers (`app.api/api.py`, `app.api/endpoints/`):**
        *   Defines the RESTful API endpoints (e.g., `/api/v1/auth/token`, `/api/v1/users/`).
        *   Handles data processing, validation, and interaction with lower layers for API requests.

    *   **Pydantic Schemas (`app.schemas/`):**
        *   Define the structure and validation rules for request and response data (JSON).
        *   Ensure data integrity and consistency throughout the API.

    *   **CRUD Operations (`app.crud/`):**
        *   Contains functions for Create, Read, Update, Delete operations on the database.
        *   Abstracts database interaction logic from the API endpoints.
        *   Interacts directly with SQLAlchemy models.

    *   **SQLAlchemy Models (`app.models/`):**
        *   Define the database table structures as Python classes.
        *   Used by SQLAlchemy ORM to map objects to database records.

    *   **Core Logic (`app.core/`):**
        *   `database.py`: Manages database connection, session setup, and base model for SQLAlchemy.
        *   `security.py`: Handles password hashing, JWT creation, and token verification.

    *   **Templates (`app.templates/`):**
        *   Jinja2 HTML templates used to render the user interface.

    *   **Static Files (`app.static/`):**
        *   Serves CSS stylesheets, JavaScript files, and other static assets.

4.  **Database (SQLite - `conference.db`):**
    *   Stores all persistent data, including user information (usernames, hashed passwords, email).
    *   SQLAlchemy ORM manages all interactions with the database.

## Data Flow Example: User Registration

1.  User fills out the registration form in the browser and submits it.
2.  An HTTP POST request is sent to the `/register` web route (`app.web.py`).
3.  The web route function might call an internal API endpoint or directly use CRUD operations.
    *   Let's assume it calls an API endpoint like `/api/v1/users/` (POST).
4.  The API endpoint (`app.api.endpoints.users.py`) receives the request.
5.  The request body is validated against a Pydantic schema (`schemas.user.UserCreate`).
6.  If validation passes, the `security.get_password_hash` function is called to hash the password.
7.  The CRUD function (`crud.user.create_user`) is called with the user data.
8.  The CRUD function creates a SQLAlchemy model instance (`models.user.User`) and adds it to the database session.
9.  SQLAlchemy commits the transaction, saving the new user to the SQLite database.
10. A success response (or redirection to login) is sent back to the client.

## Project Structure (`conference_app/`)

Your `README.md` provides an excellent overview of the project structure, which is integral to understanding the architecture. Refer to the `Project Structure` section in the main application `README.md` for a detailed file and directory layout.
