# Database Schema

The application uses SQLAlchemy to define and interact with the database. By default, it's configured to use SQLite, with the database file being `conference.db` created in the project root.

## User Model (`app/models/user.py`)

The primary model in the application is the `User` model, which stores information about registered participants.

```python
# Example from app/models/user.py (illustrative)
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String, Boolean
from ..core.database import Base

class User(Base):
    __tablename__ = "users"

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    username = Column(String, unique=True, index=True, nullable=False)
    email = Column(String, unique=True, index=True, nullable=False)
    hashed_password = Column(String, nullable=False)
    full_name = Column(String, nullable=True) # Example, if you add this field
    is_active = Column(Boolean, default=True) # Example, if you add this field
    # Add other fields as necessary, e.g., registration_date, etc.
```

**Fields:**

-   `id` (Integer, Primary Key):
    -   A unique identifier for each user.
    -   Automatically incremented.
-   `username` (String, Unique, Indexed):
    -   The chosen username for the user.
    -   Must be unique across all users.
    -   Indexed for faster lookups.
-   `email` (String, Unique, Indexed):
    -   The email address of the user.
    -   Must be unique.
    -   Indexed for faster lookups.
-   `hashed_password` (String):
    -   The user's password, securely hashed using bcrypt.
    -   Plain text passwords are never stored.
-   `full_name` (String, Optional):
    -   The full name of the user (if you decide to implement this).
-   `is_active` (Boolean, Default: True):
    -   Indicates if the user account is active (if you implement account activation/deactivation).

## Database Initialization

The database tables are automatically created based on the SQLAlchemy models when the application first starts. This is handled by the `create_db_and_tables()` function (or similar logic) often called in `main.py` or through an initial setup script if you have one.

```python
# Example from app/core/database.py or main.py (illustrative)
# from .models import user # Import your models
# from .database import engine, Base

# def create_db_and_tables():
#     Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)

# Call this function at startup
# create_db_and_tables()
```

## Relationships

Currently, the schema focuses on the `User` model. If the application evolves to include other entities (e.g., Conference Sessions, Registrations linking Users to Sessions), appropriate SQLAlchemy models and relationships (one-to-many, many-to-many) would be defined here.

For example, if there were a `Conference` model:

```python
# Illustrative example of a relationship
# class Registration(Base):
#     __tablename__ = "registrations"
#     id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
#     user_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey("users.id"))
#     conference_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey("conferences.id"))
#     registration_date = Column(DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow)

#     user = relationship("User", back_populates="registrations")
#     conference = relationship("Conference", back_populates="registrations")

# In User model:
# registrations = relationship("Registration", back_populates="user")

# In Conference model:
# registrations = relationship("Registration", back_populates="conference")
```

This section should be updated as the database schema evolves.
