# Deployment

This section covers deploying both the main Conference Registration System application and this Zudoku-based technical documentation site.

## Deploying the Main Conference Application

Deploying a FastAPI application typically involves:

1.  **Choosing a Hosting Provider:** Options include:
    *   PaaS (Platform as a Service): Heroku, Google App Engine, AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
    *   IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service): AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine, DigitalOcean Droplets (requires more manual server setup).
    *   Containerization: Docker, Kubernetes.

2.  **Preparing for Production:**
    *   **Database:** Switch from SQLite to a more robust production database like PostgreSQL or MySQL if high concurrency or scalability is needed. Update `DATABASE_URL`.
    *   **Web Server:** While Uvicorn is great for development, in production, you might run it with Gunicorn managing Uvicorn workers for better process management and scaling: `gunicorn -w 4 -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker app.main:app`.
    *   **HTTPS:** Ensure the application is served over HTTPS. This is often handled by a reverse proxy (Nginx, Caddy) or the PaaS provider.
    *   **Environment Variables:** Securely manage `SECRET_KEY`, `DATABASE_URL`, and other sensitive settings.
    *   **Static Files:** Consider serving static files via a CDN or a dedicated web server like Nginx for better performance.

3.  **Deployment Process (General Example with Docker):**
    *   Create a `Dockerfile` for your FastAPI application.
    *   Build a Docker image.
    *   Push the image to a container registry (Docker Hub, AWS ECR, Google Container Registry).
    *   Deploy the image to your chosen hosting platform.

*(This is a general guide. Specific steps vary greatly depending on the chosen hosting solution.)*

## Deploying This Documentation Site (Zudoku with GitHub Pages)

This documentation site is built with Zudoku and can be easily deployed using GitHub Pages.

### Prerequisites

1.  **Node.js and npm/pnpm/yarn:** Ensure you have Node.js installed. Zudoku uses npm/pnpm/yarn for package management.
    The `tz/package.json` is set up assuming `npm` or `pnpm` (Zudoku examples often use `pnpm`).
2.  **GitHub Repository:** Your project should be hosted on GitHub.

### Local Setup & Build (inside the `tz` directory)

1.  **Navigate to the `tz` directory:**
    ```bash
    cd tz
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install 
    # or if you prefer pnpm:
    # pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Copy OpenAPI Specification:**
    Make sure your actual `openapi.json` from your running FastAPI app (`http://localhost:8000/api/v1/openapi.json`) is copied to `tz/openapi.json`.

4.  **Build the Documentation Site:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    # or
    # pnpm build
    ```
    This command will generate the static site in a `dist` or `build` directory (Zudoku typically outputs to `.zudoku/dist` or similar, check Zudoku docs for exact path if needed, but the GitHub Action will handle this).

### Setting up GitHub Pages

1.  **Repository Settings:**
    *   Go to your GitHub repository.
    *   Click on "Settings" -> "Pages".
    *   Under "Build and deployment", for "Source", select "GitHub Actions".

2.  **Create GitHub Actions Workflow:**
    Create a file named `.github/workflows/deploy-zudoku-docs.yml` in the **root** of your project (not inside the `tz` directory) with the content provided in the next section.

### GitHub Actions Workflow File

Create the file `.github/workflows/deploy-zudoku-docs.yml`:

```yaml
name: Deploy Zudoku Docs to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main # Or your default branch
    paths:
      - 'tz/**' # Only run if files in tz/ change
      - '.github/workflows/deploy-zudoku-docs.yml' # Or if the workflow itself changes
  workflow_dispatch: # Allows manual triggering

permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

jobs:
  deploy:
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    defaults:
      run:
        working-directory: ./tz # Run all commands in the tz directory
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '18' # Or a newer LTS version
          cache: 'npm' # Or pnpm/yarn if you configured package.json for them
          cache-dependency-path: tz/package-lock.json # Or pnpm-lock.yaml / yarn.lock

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install # or pnpm install / yarn install

      - name: Build Zudoku site
        run: npm run build # or pnpm build / yarn build
        env:
          # If Zudoku needs a base path for GitHub Pages (e.g., /repository-name/)
          # Set this if your site is deployed to <username>.github.io/<repository-name>/
          # BASE_PATH: /${{ github.event.repository.name }}
          # Check Zudoku documentation if it automatically handles base path or needs this env var.
          # For root deployment (<username>.github.io), BASE_PATH is usually not needed or should be '/'

      - name: Setup Pages
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v4

      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          # Zudoku's build output directory
          # This path might need adjustment based on Zudoku's actual output. 
          # Common paths are 'build', 'dist', or '.zudoku/dist'. Verify this with Zudoku docs.
          path: ./tz/.zudoku/dist # Default for Zudoku CLI, verify!

      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

**Explanation of the Workflow:**

-   **Triggers:** Runs on pushes to `main` if files within the `tz/` directory or the workflow file itself change, and allows manual triggers.
-   **Permissions:** Sets necessary permissions for deploying to GitHub Pages.
-   **Environment:** Configures the GitHub Pages deployment environment.
-   **Working Directory:** Sets the default working directory to `./tz` for most steps.
-   **Checkout:** Checks out your repository code.
-   **Setup Node.js:** Sets up the specified Node.js version and configures caching for dependencies.
-   **Install Dependencies:** Installs Zudoku and other dependencies using `npm install` (adjust if using pnpm/yarn) inside the `tz` directory.
-   **Build Zudoku Site:** Runs `npm run build` (adjust if needed) to generate the static documentation site. 
    -   **`BASE_PATH`:** If your GitHub Pages site is at `https://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>/`, Zudoku might need a base path. The commented-out `BASE_PATH` environment variable shows how you might set this. You need to check Zudoku's documentation on how it handles base paths for sub-path deployments. If your site is `https://<username>.github.io/` (i.e., a repository named `<username>.github.io`), you likely don't need `BASE_PATH` or it should be `/`.
-   **Setup Pages:** Configures the Pages deployment.
-   **Upload Artifact:** Uploads the built Zudoku site (from `tz/.zudoku/dist` - **verify this path!**) as an artifact.
-   **Deploy to GitHub Pages:** Deploys the uploaded artifact to GitHub Pages.

### After Committing the Workflow

1.  Commit the `.github/workflows/deploy-zudoku-docs.yml` file and all the files in the `tz/` directory.
2.  Push these changes to your `main` branch on GitHub.
3.  Go to the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository. You should see the workflow running.
4.  Once the workflow completes successfully, your documentation site will be available at the URL provided in your GitHub Pages settings (usually `https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repository-name>/` or `https://<custom-domain>` if configured).

> **Important:** The `path` in the `Upload artifact` step (`path: ./tz/.zudoku/dist`) is critical. This must be the exact directory where Zudoku outputs its built static files, relative to the workspace root. Double-check Zudoku's build output location. I've used a common default for Zudoku CLI, but it can vary. If `npm run build` (or `pnpm build`) inside the `tz` directory creates, for example, a `tz/dist` or `tz/build` folder, then the path should be `tz/dist` or `tz/build` respectively.
