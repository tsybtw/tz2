# Key Features

The Conference Registration System provides a robust set of features for managing conference attendees:

- **User Registration:**
  - Allows new users to create an account by providing a username, email, and password.
  - Includes client-side and server-side validation for input data.

- **User Authentication:**
  - Secure login system for registered users.
  - Implements JWT (JSON Web Token) based authentication for secure session management.
  - Tokens are stored as HTTP-only cookies for enhanced security.

- **Password Management:**
  - Passwords are securely hashed using `bcrypt` before being stored in the database.
  - Password confirmation during registration to prevent typos.

- **Responsive User Interface:**
  - The frontend is built using Bootstrap 5, ensuring a responsive design that adapts to various screen sizes (desktops, tablets, and mobile phones).
  - Clean and intuitive user interface for easy navigation.

- **Participant Listing (Authenticated Users Only):**
  - Authenticated users can view a list of all registered participants.
  - This feature is protected and accessible only after successful login.

- **Profile Editing:**
  - Users can view and update their profile information (e.g., email, full name - if implemented).
  - Ensures that users can manage their own data.

- **Form Validation:**
  - Comprehensive validation on both client-side (using HTML5 and JavaScript) and server-side (using Pydantic models in FastAPI) to ensure data integrity.

- **Automated API Documentation:**
  - FastAPI automatically generates interactive API documentation (Swagger UI and ReDoc).
  - Accessible via `/api/v1/docs` and `/api/v1/redoc` for easy API exploration and testing.

- **Database Management:**
  - Uses SQLAlchemy ORM for database interactions.
  - Supports SQLite by default, making it easy to set up and run.
  - The database schema is automatically created on the first run of the application.

- **Modular Project Structure:**
  - Well-organized project structure separating concerns like API endpoints, database operations (CRUD), data models, Pydantic schemas, and core logic.
  This promotes maintainability and scalability.
