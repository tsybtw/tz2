# Technologies and Tools

This project leverages a modern stack of technologies and tools to deliver a robust and efficient Conference Registration System.

## Backend

- **Python 3.8+:** The core programming language used for the application logic.
- **FastAPI:** A modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.
  - *Key Features Used:* Automatic data validation, serialization, interactive API documentation (Swagger UI & ReDoc), dependency injection, asynchronous support.
- **Uvicorn:** An ASGI server used to run the FastAPI application. It provides high performance for asynchronous applications.
- **SQLAlchemy:** The Python SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper (ORM) that gives application developers the full power and flexibility of SQL.
  - *Usage:* Defines database models and handles all database interactions.
- **Pydantic:** Data validation and settings management using Python type annotations. FastAPI uses Pydantic models extensively for request and response data validation.
  - *Requirement:* Requires Rust for compilation of some components, enhancing performance.
- **Bcrypt:** A library for hashing passwords securely. It's used to protect user credentials.
- **Python-JOSE:** A JavaScript Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE) technologies implementation in Python, used for creating and verifying JWTs.

## Frontend

- **HTML5:** The standard markup language for creating web pages.
- **CSS3:** Used for styling the web pages.
  - `app/static/css/style.css`: Custom styles for the application.
- **JavaScript:** For client-side interactivity and form validation.
  - `app/static/js/main.js`: Custom JavaScript for the application.
- **Bootstrap 5:** A popular CSS framework for developing responsive and mobile-first websites. It provides pre-built components and a grid system for layout.
- **Jinja2:** A modern and designer-friendly templating engine for Python, used by FastAPI to render HTML templates.

## Database

- **SQLite:** The default relational database management system used. It's a serverless, self-contained, transactional SQL database engine. Easy to set up as it stores the database in a single file (`conference.db`).
  - *Configurable:* The `DATABASE_URL` environment variable can be used to switch to other SQL databases supported by SQLAlchemy (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL).

## Development & Environment

- **Virtual Environments (`venv`):** Used to create isolated Python environments to manage project dependencies.
- **Pip:** The package installer for Python, used to install packages listed in `requirements.txt`.
- **Git & GitHub:** Version control system and hosting platform for collaborative development and code management.
- **Visual Studio with C++ build tools (Windows):** Required for compiling certain Python dependencies that have C++ extensions.
- **Rust:** Required by Pydantic for performance-critical components.

## Documentation (This Site)

- **Zudoku:** An open-source, highly customizable API documentation framework used to generate this technical specification site.
- **MDX:** Markdown with JSX, allowing for rich content creation within documentation pages.
- **GitHub Pages:** Used for deploying and hosting this documentation website.
- **GitHub Actions:** To automate the build and deployment process of the Zudoku documentation to GitHub Pages.
