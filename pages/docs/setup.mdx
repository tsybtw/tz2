# Main Application: Setup and Installation

This section details how to set up and run the Conference Registration System application itself. For instructions on this documentation site, see the [Deployment](/deployment) page.

## Requirements

-   Python 3.8+
-   Rust (required for pydantic's performance-critical components)
-   Visual Studio with C++ build tools (Windows only, for some Python dependencies)
-   Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

## Installation Steps

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/conference_app.git # Replace with your repo URL
cd conference_app
```

### 2. Install Prerequisites

#### Rust Installation

Rust is required for building some Python dependencies like Pydantic.

-   **Windows:**
    -   Download and run the installer from the official Rust website: [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
    -   Alternatively, use rustup: [https://rustup.rs/](https://rustup.rs/)

-   **macOS/Linux:**
    ```bash
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
    ```

#### Visual Studio with C++ Build Tools (Windows)

Some Python packages require C++ compilation. On Windows, you'll need Visual Studio build tools:

1.  Download the Visual Studio installer from: [https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/)
2.  Run the installer and select "Desktop development with C++".
3.  Complete the installation.

### 3. Set Up Python Environment

It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment.

-   **Windows:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

-   **macOS/Linux:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

### 4. Install Dependencies

With your virtual environment activated:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Configure Environment (Optional but Recommended)

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project (`conference_app/.env`). This file is used to store sensitive information and configuration settings.

**Example `.env` content:**

```env
SECRET_KEY=your_super_secret_random_key_here_please_change_me
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./conference.db
# For PostgreSQL, it might look like:
# DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/dbname
```

-   `SECRET_KEY`: A long, random string used for cryptographic signing (e.g., JWTs). **Generate a strong, unique key for your application.**
-   `DATABASE_URL`: The connection string for your database. Defaults to SQLite.

> **Important:** Ensure `.env` is added to your `.gitignore` file to prevent committing secrets to version control.

## Running the Application

### 1. Activate Your Virtual Environment

```bash
# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 2. Start the Application

```bash
python run.py
```

This command will typically start the Uvicorn server.

### 3. Access the Application

Open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:8000
```

> **Note:** The application should automatically create the SQLite database (`conference.db`) on its first run if it doesn't already exist, based on the SQLAlchemy models.

## After Installation

-   The database will be created automatically on the first run.
-   Register at least one user to access features requiring authentication.
-   Once logged in, you can view registered participants and edit your profile (depending on implemented features).
-   The JWT token is stored as an HTTP-only cookie and typically expires after 30 minutes (this is configurable).

## API Documentation (Auto-Generated)

FastAPI automatically generates interactive API documentation:

-   **Swagger UI:** `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/docs`
-   **ReDoc:** `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/redoc`
-   **OpenAPI Spec:** `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/openapi.json` (This is the file you should copy into `tz/openapi.json` for this documentation site).
